# React Cart 2.0

## Overview: 

This is a full stack MERN application with Redux that allows a user to build out a shopping list. Simply add items to your list using the 'add item' button and delete them using the red 'x'. Very simple on the surface. The main purpose of this project was to showcase my ability to build and deploy a full stack MERN application and introduce working knowledge of Redux.
